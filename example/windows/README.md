# Windows Example Setup

This directory contains the Windows-specific files for the flutter_vless example app.

## Xray Setup

Before running the example on Windows, you need to provide the Xray executable:

1. **Download Xray-core** (version 25.10.15 or later):
   - Visit: https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases
   - Download `Xray-windows-64.zip` (or `Xray-windows-32.zip` for 32-bit systems)

2. **Extract and place xray.exe**:
   - Extract the downloaded archive
   - Locate `xray.exe` in the extracted files
   - Copy `xray.exe` to: `example/windows/xray/xray.exe`
   - Delete the placeholder file: `<xray_paste_here.exe.txt>`

3. **Verify the structure**:
   ```
   example/
     windows/
       xray/
         xray.exe  ← Should be here
   ```

## Running the Example

Once xray.exe is in place, you can run the example:

```bash
cd example
flutter run -d windows
```

Or build the Windows app:

```bash
cd example
flutter build windows
```

## Notes

- The plugin will automatically detect xray.exe in the `windows/xray/` directory
- If xray.exe is not found, the app will show an error message
- Make sure xray.exe has execute permissions
- The plugin will create temporary configuration files automatically

## Troubleshooting

**xray.exe not found:**
- Verify the file is named exactly `xray.exe` (not `xray.exe.exe`)
- Check that the file is in `example/windows/xray/` directory
- Ensure the file is not corrupted (try downloading again)

**Permission errors:**
- Run the app as Administrator if needed
- Check Windows Defender or antivirus isn't blocking xray.exe

**Connection issues:**
- Verify your Xray configuration is valid JSON
- Check that the server address and port are correct
- Ensure your firewall allows the connection
